## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Reset database from scratch (Supabase + Prisma)

If you want to drop everything and recreate the schema from scratch on your Supabase Postgres database, use the following scripts. This is destructive and will erase ALL data in the target schema defined by `DATABASE_URL`.

Warning: Do NOT use on a database that contains valuable production data. Prefer separate databases or schemas per environment.

```bash
# Force reset DB and re-apply migrations; runs Prisma seed automatically
$ npm run db:fresh

# Start the app after a fresh reset in dev
$ npm run start:fresh:dev

# Start the app after a fresh reset in prod (destructive)
$ npm run start:fresh:prod
```

Notes:
- The reset uses `prisma migrate reset --force`, which drops and recreates the schema, reapplies migrations, and then runs the Prisma seed.
- Seeding is wired via the `prisma.seed` command in `package.json`, which calls `ts-node src/scripts/seed/seed.script.ts`.
- Ensure your `.env` has `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the correct Supabase instance you intend to wipe.
- If you encounter `P3009 migrate found failed migrations...`, running `npm run db:fresh` will reset the state and reapply migrations cleanly.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
